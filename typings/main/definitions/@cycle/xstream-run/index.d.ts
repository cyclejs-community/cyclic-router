/**
 * A function that prepares the Cycle application to be executed. Takes a `main`
 * function and prepares to circularly connects it to the given collection of
 * driver functions. As an output, `Cycle()` returns an object with three
 * properties: `sources`, `sinks` and `run`. Only when `run()` is called will
 * the application actually execute. Refer to the documentation of `run()` for
 * more details.
 *
 * **Example:**
 * ```js
 * const {sources, sinks, run} = Cycle(main, drivers);
 * // ...
 * const dispose = run(); // Executes the application
 * // ...
 * dispose();
 * ```
 *
 * @param {Function} main a function that takes `sources` as input
 * and outputs a collection of `sinks` Observables.
 * @param {Object} drivers an object where keys are driver names and values
 * are driver functions.
 * @return {Object} an object with three properties: `sources`, `sinks` and
 * `run`. `sources` is the collection of driver sources, `sinks` is the
 * collection of driver sinks, these can be used for debugging or testing. `run`
 * is the function that once called will execute the application.

 * (to be given to drivers). A "collection of Observables" is a JavaScript
 * object where keys match the driver names registered by the `drivers` object,
